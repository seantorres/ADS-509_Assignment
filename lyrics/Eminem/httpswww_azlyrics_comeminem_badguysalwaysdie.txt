"Bad Guys Always Die"



The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha, ride

All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die

He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, "Take ten paces," shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a "G Thang"
And a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin'"
I said, "It's Dre's day," and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die (Always die)

The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha-ha, ride, ha
