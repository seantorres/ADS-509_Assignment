"happy"



I want to stay inside forever
In that worn-out yellow sweater
The warmth I used to feel is still there
Heavy signs like clouds, surround me
Why do they feel so lonely?
I can't pretend to care

I'm trying to be happy
I'm trying to find a way in this unrelenting world
Where I promised that I would stay
I'll figure it out then you'll see
I'm everything I ever claimed to be
Smile through the dark, to the sky, laugh away

Never thought I'd put my phone down
Suffocating in a bubble, who's wearing the crown?
Everyone's looking for the next big thing
While I'm still so lost in a closing ring of faces
The shameless (A sad mess) constantly walking an endless
Road to the moon, to the stars
And they hope to God you get far
An eternity's too long to stay on the stage
When will I turn the next page?

Let me stay inside forever
In that worn-out yellow sweater
When will the colors fade?
This pretty, pretty palette of dull shades
What's the definition of a good friend?
It's hard to tell in this mad race to the end
Can I live so unafraid?

I'm trying to be happy
I'm trying to find a way in this unrelenting world
Where I promised that I would stay
I'll figure it out then you'll see
I'm everything I ever claimed to be
Smile through the dark, to the sky, laugh away
I'm trying to be happy
