"If There Was A Zombie Apocalypse I'd Let My Dog Eat Me"



If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me

I'd start with the thighs where the fatty part lies
Thick thighs save lives
Quite literally this time
My flesh will taste okay
My dog will eat the pain away
'Cause the whole world is dying
And I'm tired of surviving

If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me
The situation's dire
And my house's on fire
But at least she'd be healthy
If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me
There are zombies full of lead
And my friends are all dead
But at least she'd be healthy

If there was a zombie apocalypse
If there was a-
If there was a-
If there was a zombie apocalypse
If there was a zombie apocalypse
If there was a-
If there was a-
If there was a zombie apocalypse
(Temmie!)

I wish I had more time
But there goes my spine
I'm not alone
Because she's chewing my bones
My body's bleeding out
She's eaten half my torso now
Think I'm losing my eyesight
I've been here all night

If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me
The situation's dire
And my house's on fire
But at least she'd be healthy
If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me
There are zombies full of lead
And my friends are all dead
But at least she'd be healthy

If there was a zombie apocalypse
If there was a-
If there was a-
If there was a zombie apocalypse
If there was a zombie apocalypse
If there was a-
If there was a-
If there was a zombie apocalypse

If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me
The situation's dire
And my house's on fire
But at least she'd be healthy
If there was a zombie apocalypse
I'd let my dog eat me
There are zombies full of lead
And my friends are all dead
But at least she'd be healthy
(If there was a zombie apocaly-)
