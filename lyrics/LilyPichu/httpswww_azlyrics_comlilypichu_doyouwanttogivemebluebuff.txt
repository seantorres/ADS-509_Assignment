"Do You Want To Give Me Blue Buff?"



Amumu?
Do you want to give me blue buff?
Come on, let's go and play
You never gank mid anymore
It's such a bore
It's like you're AFK
We used to help each other
But now we don't
I wish you would tell me why

Do you want to give me blue buff?
(It doesn't have to be a blue buff)
(Go away, Annie)
Okay, bye...

Do you want to give me blue buff?
Or help me even out the score?
I think a gank for mid is overdue
I've started talking to
The merchant at the store
(Hang in there, Doran!)
It gets a little lonely
All these empty pots
Just watching the game go by...

Amumu?
Please, I know you're still there
Teammates are asking where you've been
They say report, but I'm not going to
I'm still in game with you
Just help me win
We only have each other
Just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you want to give me blue buff?
