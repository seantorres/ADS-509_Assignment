"FOUND"



[Natsumiii:]
Take a boat and leave
To an island with many trees
And there's a song in every breeze
That makes you never want to leave
When the stars don't shine no more
And moonlight's scattered on the shore
We'll come around
We'll be around
I think we're all just waiting to be found
I think we're all just waiting to be found
