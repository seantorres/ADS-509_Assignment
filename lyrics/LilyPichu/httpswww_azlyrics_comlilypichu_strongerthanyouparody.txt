"Stronger Than You Parody"



I didn't think that you'd stand here
Let me tell you it was easy making all of your friends disappear
You think you've won?
Now hold still this'll hurt a skele-ton
I'm a saint, don't ask me how
Hey, Sans, I guess you're sans a brother now
So, let's go just me and you
I wonder if you always knew?

Go ahead and try to stop me if you're able
Can't you see that my determination's stable?
Never knew resetting worlds could be fulfilling
Once you spare me, I'll just keep on killing
Everybody thinks that I'll come save 'em
Even though this path is what I'm cravin'
This story has an ending after this fight
You'll be burning in hell through the night

I'm not afraid of love, love
Love, love, love

This is where we are
This is how it ends
I don't know why you think that there's a chance we could be friends
But, somewhere deep inside me, I'm screaming out your name
I've given up myself, I know we'll never be the same

Go ahead and try to stop me if you're able
You know that my determination's stable
All the promises you kept are slowly dying
I guess you must be so sick of trying
I wanna the one to paint it black
Your sins are done crawling all over my back
There's no one to save
This will be your grave
Despite all the chances that you gave

I'm not afraid of love, love
And I'll do it again
Love, love, love
And I'll do it again
Love, love, love
And I'll do it again
