"not too late"



They say you'll never be a star
That you started much too late
To change your fate, I'm trying
Though, I didn't start at eight
I want to try something new
I want to find a reason to

I can still create something great
And it's still not too late

I wanted to play violin long ago
But I wasn't four so my mom said no (Said no)
I could never be a child prodigy
Ten years ago, I didn't plant a tree
The future was something that I couldn't see
If I had been a little faster
I'd have a lot more skills I could master
It's hard to say when you've lost the precious time of yesterday
So many things you could learn
You'll bloom just like a flower
Stop thinking about the past and
What could have been for hours and hours
It was unfair, I was there
I wish I could tell a younger me
To forgive yourself for not starting
You would get there eventually

I can still create something great
And it's still not too late
