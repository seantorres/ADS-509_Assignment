"See You"



Hold on
Just for me
The memory
Is all I need

Your hand in mine
Tonight
And the joy
That you bring

You were
Something new for me
Now you're
Everything

When I see you
By my side
My heart comes
Alive

I'll see you
Again
When our hearts come alive

I need you
So close
Beside me

So run my way
Run my way

Run back into my heart

I'll see you again
I'll see you then
Darling

You were
Something new
Now you're mine
Everything

When I see you
By my side
My heart comes
Alive

I'll see you
Again
When our hearts come alive
I need you
Close
Beside me

I'll see you
Again
When we grow cold
I need you
To take
Me home
