"last cup of coffee"



Someday we'll have our last conversation
And drink our last cup of coffee
Someday we might be eighty
And think about the different things we used to say
All the memories of you will just become a ghost
Of a smile caught in the wind
Someday, it'll be the last day

One day it could be over
The moon, could seem so far away
Despite all the adventures that we
Promised we'd go on again and again
All the memories of you and all the stories
We were part of, lost in the wind
Someday, it'll be the last day

I won't forget how it feels to be loved
To be remembered by someone as special as you
Someday I will drink that last cup of coffee with a smile

I won't forget how it feels to be loved
To be remembered by someone as special as you
Someday I will drink that last cup of coffee with a smile
