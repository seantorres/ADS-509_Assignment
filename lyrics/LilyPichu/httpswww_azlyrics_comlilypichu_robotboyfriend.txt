"Robot Boyfriend"



You're loud, and you code, and you hate eating fish
You swear with your projects, you have a death wish
Your tasers and jokes, I just can't comprehend
I guess you're my robot boyfriend

There's nothing I break that you say you can't fix
You make silly faces when we're taking cute pics
But there with all I just want you in the end
'Cause you're my robot boyfriend
(Woo)
