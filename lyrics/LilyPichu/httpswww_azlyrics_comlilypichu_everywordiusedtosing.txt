"every word i used to sing"



Every melody I played
All the memories we made
Did they ever even cross your mind?
After all this time?
Was I the only one waiting?

A garden of my favorite flowers
Where we stayed until the dark
Should we make another stop
At the beach or at the park?
Let's talk some more
Our footprints are fading on the shore

I used to think bonds like ours stayed forever
No matter how far apart
I thought I'd have a piece of
Every heart
Soul
Sky
I sigh in the breeze
Where are you now?

Waiting for a sign
When all of the stars will realign
Didn't we make a promise
We would meet some day?
If only for today?
Was I the only one dreaming?

The moment that we met
I wish I could see your eyes again
And tell you what I thought
I truly felt
We'd say hello
How are you?
I hope you're listening
To every melody I play.
