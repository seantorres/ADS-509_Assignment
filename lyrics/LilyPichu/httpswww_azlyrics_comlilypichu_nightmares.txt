"Nightmares"



Hey hey, wake up, a new adventure lies ahead of us
Hey hey, remember that cave we found yesterday?

Did you pack our swords and lanterns?
'Cause I think there's something living in here
Not that I'm scared or anything
But I think I saw something up there

If a scary sight comes biting like a fiend
I will stand and fight, yeah you can count on me
I will protect you from this dark, dark, dark, dark

World, full of lies
Did you think you could rise against us?
Don't you know who we
A-are, a-are?
We are the lights
Who dare to shine in the sights of nightmares
For you, for truth, for hope, for love

Poor little creature, bitten and bleeding
Don't give up hope
I'll wrap you up and take you to safety
Don't give up hope
We fought the demon that had attacked you
Please rest and heal, mmh-mmh
I want to save you, please let me save you
Don't give up hope

Hey hey, this place it's kinda scary, but we'll be okay
Big bro, I'll let you go first and be my shield
No deal

Did you pack our mana potions?
'Cause there's something evil living in here
Not, haha, not that I'm scared or anything
But I think it's good to be prepared

If a scary sight comes biting like a fiend
I will stand and fight, yeah you can count on me
I will protect you from this dark, dark, dark, dark

World, full of lies
Did you think you could rise against us?
Don't you know who we
A-are, a-are?
We are the weak
Who dared to take on a sea of nightmares
Protecting hopes and dreams for all

What have we here, little ones?
Did you really think that you could defeat me?
I spy with my big red eyes
A feast for me in youthful splendor

I won't let you do it, I won't even let you try
I might be scared and I might just cry
But I will stand and I will fight
I will not let you take our lives away

But now that I've caught you in this cage
Nothing you say will change your fate
You've lost, you're doomed, you're here to stay
The two of you cannot escape

Big brother, what should we do?
I, I don't know
But we're definitely getting out of this place
Yeah, there has to be an exit somewhere

Wait
Do you hear that?
Yeah, it's... it's the creature we saved
Wow, there's aâ€”, there's a ton of 'em
There's an entire army
They're here to help us
We should fight too

World, full of lies
Did you think you could rise against us?
Don't you know who we
A-are, a-are?
We are the kind
That dare to fight and defy the nightmares
Protecting hopes and dreams for all

Hey hey, wake up, a new adventure lies ahead of us
Hey hey, wake up, up, up, up, if a scary sight
Comes biting like a fiend (did you pack our swords and lanterns?)
I will stand and fight, yeah you can count on me
('Cause I think there's something living in here)
I will protect you from this dark
Hey hey, wake up
