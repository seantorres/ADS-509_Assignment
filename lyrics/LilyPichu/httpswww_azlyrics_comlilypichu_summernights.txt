"summer nights"



Quiet summer nights, flowers in the rain
I wish on all the stars it'd stay the same
I keep them in my heart, the endless feelings of
Fragile tiny pieces of our love

We once found it kind of strange
How everything can change and fade away
But now I look up at the distant sky
And remember all those quiet summer nights

Starlight in your eyes, beautiful and bright
I think of how our worlds must have appeared so close
That summer night, if I could try again
We'd fly through the cosmos

Can we sit here for a while?
Just for a little bit
This is kind of nice, don't you think?
