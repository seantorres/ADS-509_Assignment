"POM POM"



Raindrops, star drops
The clouds won't stop
My umbrella hangs by the door
The sky's a hue, the darkest of blue
Now I swear I've felt this before

Your scent in the air
Are you still there?

When days are long, I sing a song
A tiny pom rolls around
A memory, a distant dream
You'll always stay in my heart

It's safe inside, you don't have to hide
In the place we've made just our style
The worlds we'd find, let's lose track of time
So, please, won't you stay for a while?

Your scent in the air
Are you still there?

When days are long, I sing a song
A tiny pom rolls around
A memory, a distant dream
You'll always stay in my heart

When days are long, I sing a song
A tiny pom rolls around
A memory, a distant dream
You'll always stay in my heart
You'll always stay in my heart

La-da-da-da, la-da-da
La, la-da-da, bum, da-da
